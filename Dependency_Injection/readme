🍽️ The Royal Kitchen — A Story-Based FastAPI Project
👨‍🍳 Dependency Injection in a Fun Way!
Ever wondered how chefs cook their best dishes without worrying about where the ingredients come from?

Welcome to the Royal Kitchen , where chefs arrive daily and are given exactly what they need to create magic — no questions asked. 🪄 

This small FastAPI app demonstrates Dependency Injection (DI) using a fun kitchen-themed story.

📖 Story: The Kingdom’s Royal Kitchen
In a faraway kingdom, the King opens a Royal Kitchen where different chefs come every day to cook special dishes.

But there's one rule:

Chefs must be given only their favorite ingredients — nothing else! 

So:

🍅 An Italian Chef gets Tomato Sauce
🌶️ An Indian Chef gets Masala Mix
They don’t make or find these themselves — they are given these ingredients when they start cooking.

That’s Dependency Injection in action!

🔧 How It Works
🍝 Ingredients
TomatoSauce
,
MasalaMix
— dependencies used by chefs
👨‍🍳 Chefs
ItalianChef
,
IndianChef
— use dependencies to cook
📦 Dependency Providers
get_tomato_sauce()
,
get_masala_mix()
🚀 Routes
/italian-chef
,
/indian-chef

✅ API Endpoints

Bilkul! Neeche main apko ek achay say likhi hui aur interesting README file deta hoon jo:

📖 Story-based hai
🎨 Icons aur emojis ke saath styled hai
🧑‍🍳 Chef theme ka istemal karta hai
💡 Dependency Injection ko samjhata hai ek mazay daar tareeqe se
Aap isko README.md naam ki file mein save kar sakte hain apni project folder mein.

💡 Why This Matters
This simple example shows how Dependency Injection helps keep code:

🔌 Loosely Coupled
🧪 Easy to Test
🔄 Easy to Modify
Even though it’s just a chef and some sauce, this is how real-world apps inject databases, APIs and services.
